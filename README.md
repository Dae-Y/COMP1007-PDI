## COMP1007 - Programming Design and Implementation

#### Assignment Outcome
> - Design a solution to a given problem using pseudocode.<br>
> - Identify the datatypes required within the designed solution.<br>
> - Create simple classes to aid in the designed solution.<br>
> - Use programming skills to implement your design in Java.<br>
> - Construct well structured and documented Java code.

#### Background
Large amounts of data are made available for free by all different organisations and governments around the world.<br>
Canada is one such government.<br>
open data sets are available from: https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data. <br>
