Large amounts of data are made available for free by all different 
organisations and governments around the world. Canada is one such 
government. A large number of open data sets are available from: https://
 open.canada.ca/en/open-data. To understand their philosophy about this, you 
can read the following web page: https://open.canada.ca/en. 
The “Investments in Indigenous community infrastructure" dataset is one such 
dataset and is available for download from: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/
 dataset/62155d6f-9167-4972-b77c-b90734b628dc. On that same web page it 
states: “The Targeted Investments in Indigenous Community Infrastructure 
dataset depicts infrastructure projects across Canada that are funded 
through Indigenous Services Canada (ISC)." 
This is the dataset that will be used within this assignment.
